# Task 1 - Iris Dataset Exploration and Visualization

## Objective
The objective of this task is to load, inspect, and visualize the Iris dataset to understand feature trends and distributions.

## Dataset Used
- Iris Dataset (loaded using seaborn)

## Tools / Libraries Used
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Work Done
- Loaded the dataset
- Checked shape, column names, and first few rows
- Used `.info()` and `.describe()` for dataset summary
- Created scatter plots to observe relationships between features
- Created histograms to observe distributions
- Created box plots to identify outliers

## Key Findings
- Petal length and petal width show clear separation among species.
- Sepal features overlap more compared to petal features.
- Dataset has no missing values.
- Sepal features overlap more compared to petal features.
- Dataset has no missing values.
